The release history of OpenCards

A more polished but slighty reduced version (targetting end-users rather than developers) can be found at
http://opencards.blogspot.com/search/label/release


OpenCards 2 (in progress)
* presentation mode for learning (in progress
    - allow switching between presentation mode and edit mode within session
    - auto execute animations, movies, sounds, etcs.
	- use hiding of answer elements instead of temporary slides (if possible; may use temporary slide effects; how to block slide transitions by clicking onto the slide?)
* tag arbitrary shapes as question via shape-context menu (done)
    - support random question mode also with tag-question (done)
    - allow multi-shape tagging (done)
    - simply prefer tags of title-shapes (done)
* sortable columns in LTM-Manager (done)
* fix all modality-issues (depends on still unsolved OO-framework bug http://www.openoffice.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=83596 )
* time-dependent statistics
    - record item-histories
    - provide more statistics tabs in LTM-Manager
* in-day rescheduling: Reschedule new/unknown cards if necessary for the same day
    - open question: how to visualize this in the schedule-tab
